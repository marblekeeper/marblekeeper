## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

**Senior Systems & Tools Programmer** with 8+ years of experience in engine architecture, pipeline automation, and high-performance gameplay systems. Expert in **C# (.NET 9), C (C99), and Python**, with a proven track record of shipping commercial middleware and Blender tools. Specialized in **ECS architectures**, Data-Oriented Design, and optimizing asset pipelines for real-time rendering on mobile and desktop platforms.

## TECHNICAL SKILLS

* **Languages:** C#, C (C99), Python (Blender API), GLSL, C++, SQL.
* **Engines & Frameworks:** Unity, OpenGL ES, .NET 9, MSYS2/GCC.
* **Systems Architecture:** Entity-Component-System (ECS), Data-Oriented Design (DOD), Domain-Specific Languages (DSL), Binary Serialization.
* **Tools & Workflow:** Git, Blender API, RenderDoc, MkDocs, CI/CD, Technical Art Pipelines.

## WORK EXPERIENCE

### Principal Engine Architect | Collecto.dev

**January 2019 – Present | Remote**

* Architected and maintained **MarbleEngine**, a high-performance, data-oriented ECS simulation engine optimized for mobile hardware.
* Achieved performance benchmarks of **65,000 entities at 60 FPS** through rigorous memory layout optimization and cache-locality strategies. This was to respect the nintendo switch runtime memory constraints.
* Engineered a custom binary serialization format (.mcache) using **memory-mapped files**, reducing asset load times by **95%** (145ms to 8ms).
* Developed **MarbleScript**, a custom DSL compiler that decoupled gameplay logic from core engine systems, enabling real-time hot-reloading of game rules.
* **Tech Stack:** C#, C, OpenGL ES, Compiler Design, Memory Management, Lua.

### Python Tools Developer | Independent Freelance

**January 2017 – Present | Remote**

* Developed and shipped commercial workflow automation tools (Blender Add-ons) currently utilized by hundreds of active users.
* Automated complex 3D asset pipelines (UV unwrapping/rigging) using the **Blender Python API**, reducing artist overhead and repetitive manual workflows.
* Built custom UI panels and batch-processing scripts to streamline cross-departmental handoffs between art and engineering.
* Maintained full backward compatibility across Blender versions 2.8 through 4.x via modular API abstraction layers.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, Blender API, Git, UI/UX Design.

### Gameplay Programmer | Little Leaf Interactive

**2022 – 2023 | [Remote]**

* Co-developed and shipped **WORD SNKE** for iOS and Android, focusing on core gameplay loops and performance stability.
* Optimized UI rendering and game logic to ensure consistent 30/60 FPS performance on legacy mobile chipsets.
* Managed version control via Git and performed technical code reviews to ensure codebase scalability and minimize technical debt.
* Weekly QA review and product consultation for core production decisions and direction.
* **Tech Stack:** Unity, C#, Mobile Optimization, Version Control.

## PROJECTS

**MarbleEngine Architecture (ECS)** | *[[GitHub Link](https://github.com/marblekeeper/MarbleEngine)]*

* Developed a production-ready ECS implementation featuring sparse-set storage and high-concurrency systems.
* Published comprehensive benchmarks detailing memory layout performance and cache miss reductions.

**Commercial Blender Add-on: [Curvemesher](https://superhivemarket.com/products/curvemesher)**

* Released a specialized tool for 3D Modeling. Successfully managed the full product lifecycle from requirements gathering to post-launch support.

**Commercial Blender Add-on: [BrushBatcher](https://superhivemarket.com/products/brush-batcher)**

* Released a specialized tool for 3D Texturing. Successfully managed the full product lifecycle from requirements gathering to post-launch support.

## EDUCATION

**Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**
[Western Governors University] | Expected October 2026

* **Focus:** Advanced Compiler Theory, Operating Systems, and Algorithm Analysis.
* **Note:** Leveraging 8 years of professional engineering experience to supplement academic curriculum.
* Decided to return to formally get the degree to provide more opportunities.
